figure out centos go install, try 1.20 profile optimized compilation

browser plugins

liked icon in search results?

SEO data: page description, other stuff probably

alignemnt of search/signout menu text

italics angle

consistent db query for getting post: id or id + user id?

renamed /post/1 to /saved/1 ?

big refactor: post object should be metadata only and this should be clear. getting the body should just get a string probably

refactor: as convention, in each handler, at the beginning declare the string which will hold the error message to say on

HIGHLIGHTS

- span styling: typography adding space? breaks table layouts and moves thing very slightly
- prevent overlap
- button instead of instant on click
